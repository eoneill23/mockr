## Overview
Mockr is a web app that improves the mock interview process. Interviewers can ask students questions, leave notes about the interviewees' responses to those questions, rate their responses on a scale from 1-4, rate the interview as a whole on a scale from 1-4, provide final notes on the interview, and email the results of the interview to the student.

## Successes
* **React Hooks** - This was the team's first deep dive into using React Hooks. We were able to implement a number of different hooks, including useState, useEffect, and more.
* **React Context** - Since our team felt fairly comfortable using Redux to help manage a global state, we decided to challenge ourselves and use React Context.
* **Apollo** - This was our team's first attempt at using Apollo client to query our backend. Before this project, we had almost exclusively used the Fetch API to CRUD data, but implementing Apollo client streamlined our CRUD process on the frontend and made everything easy to interface with.
* **GraphQL** - With only having experience building RESTful routes prior to this project, it felt very foreign breaking those rules using GraphQL. It was challenging in the beginning getting used to the new syntax and file structure, but once we figured out the workflow, the process of setting up endpoints got smoother with each iteration. During development, we realized how much more dynamic GraphQL was, with being able to get as much or as little data as we needed by only changing arguments in the queries to a single endpoint. 
* **Planning** - We didn't write a single line of code other than setting up our two repositories on GitHub and integrating Travis CI for the first four days of the project. We took that time to really think through our user stories and what technologies we wanted to use, which really helped the rest of the project go smoothly.
* **Collaboration** - This was the first time at Turing that we worked in a front-end and a back-end team to build a fairly large application. The early stage planning as well as effective, open, and frequent communication helped make the project a success.

## Challenges
* **Front-end testing** - Because we were fairly ambitious with the new technologies we wanted to use on the front end, testing those new technologies was definitely a challenge. We definitely would have liked to have more time to dedicate to testing and improve our overall test coverage.
* **Weather** - The three days leading up to the submission date were snow days at Turing, meaning there was no class and that everyone was remote. It was challenging only being able to communicate over Slack as the deadline approached, but we were able to effectively communicate through Slack and GitHub issues.

## Project management
We utilized GitHub projects and GitHub issues to keep track of the status of our project.
